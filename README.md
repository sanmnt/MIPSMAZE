# MIPSMAZE
This project has three phases:
1. The Blank Maze
2. A Maze with One Path
3. A completed Maze


This program uses the Assembly Language MIPS to generate a random maze of up to a 38x38 block maze. For best results use the MARS MIPS Simulator. 
The printouts are example printouts of the program.
